# Pixel Physics
This is a practice project I made in order to learn Rust.
Download and run the executable in order to use the project.

**KNOWN BUG:** The clock speed is currently not set so the game just runs as fast as possible.

You cannot change the brush size yet.

**KEYBINDS:**
* [1] - ROCK is immovable
* [2] - SAND has gravity
* [3] - WATER has gravity
* [4] - AIR/ERASER to delete stuff
